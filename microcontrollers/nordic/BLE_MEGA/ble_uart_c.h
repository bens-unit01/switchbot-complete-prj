 * @brief    Heart Rate Service Client module.
 *
 * @details  This module contains the APIs and types exposed by the Heart Rate Service Client
 *           module. These APIs and types can be used by the application to perform discovery of
 *           Heart Rate Service at the peer and interact with it.
 *
 * @warning  Currently this module only has support for Heart Rate Measurement characteristic. This
 *           means that it will be able to enable notification of the characteristic at the peer and
 *           be able to receive Heart Rate Measurement notifications from the peer. It does not
 *           support the Body Sensor Location and the Heart Rate Control Point characteristics.
 *           When a Heart Rate Measurement is received, this module will decode only the
 *           Heart Rate Measurement Value (both 8 bit and 16 bit) field from it and provide it to
 *           the application.
 *
 * @note     The application must propagate BLE stack events to this module by calling
 *           ble_uart_c_on_ble_evt().
