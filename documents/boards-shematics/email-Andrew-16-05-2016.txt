That is excellent news! Were there any surprises? Is there anything that you wanted done differently?

All of the connections between the SOM and STM boards are done through the one connector at the bottom centre of the board. 
It’s designed to “stack” with a 4x8 2mm pitch male-to-male header. I use four 1x8 headers; it’s MUCH cheaper and electrically no different.

I believe that there is some kernel work required on the SOM; they use the I/O in a very specific arrangement and have mentioned a couple of
times now that software changes on the SOM are required to take advantage of all of the I/O we want to use.

I suspect that there will be some device tree changes and some GPIO changes, but little else. This is one aspect of the SOM design that we 
	have not yet been able to get from them.

As far as the resistor jumpers on the motor board. I will gather this information for you, but they will be of little use until we get updated software for the SOM.

The pins on J20 and J12 are arranged in four rows.  On the bottom of the board you will see one pin that is “square” and the rest are round. 
That square pin is pin 1, and then the ordering is that the first “column" of 4 pins is 1,2,3,4. Pin 5 is immediately beside pin 1, so the 
next column is 5,6,7,8. This pattern continues until you reach the opposite end of the row of 8 pins, which gives 29,30,31,32.


I would supply 5V to the board stack from the USB port on the MOTOR board; the charge circuitry on the SOM board is not correct and will not 
work correctly even for basic powering of the board stack.

This is excellent news.

No problem. I was hoping to hear from them on how to recreate the android partition map but have not heard anything back either.
