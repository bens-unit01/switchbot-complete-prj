[10:54:56 AM] *** Davin Sufer added Andrew, raouf.bensalem ***
[10:54:58 AM] Davin Sufer: Hey guys
[10:55:07 AM] Davin Sufer: Step 1 we want to bring up the ST board.
[10:55:17 AM] Davin Sufer: Lets use this for Q and A
[10:55:20 AM] Andrew: ok
[10:55:26 AM] Andrew: Good morning Raouf
[10:55:35 AM] Davin Sufer: Which adaptor board were you speaking of?
[10:56:22 AM] Andrew: Do you remember the quadcopter hack boards (adding XYZ GestureSense to them)? there was a tiny 
                     adapter board which converted the 0.050” standard ARM JTAG to the 5/6 pin format that WW uses

[10:56:35 AM] Davin Sufer: oh
[10:56:38 AM] Andrew: I used that to create an easy way to get SWD hooked up
[10:56:48 AM] Davin Sufer: ok, so we can just make our own cable and avoid that issue
[10:56:58 AM] Davin Sufer: Is the header on the board well marked/correct?
[10:57:07 AM] Davin Sufer: I will look in the folder you sent over
[10:57:13 AM] Andrew: except SWDIO and SWDCK are reversed, and I spent a lot of time panicking because the STM32s were responding, but incorrectly
[10:57:21 AM] Andrew: yes, those are marked correctly
[10:57:58 AM] Andrew: I have updated schematics too (no physical changes, just part value changes, Altium wants it to be used one way and after
                     20 years in Eagle my muscle memory is still programmed for the Eagle way
		     
[10:58:08 AM] Davin Sufer: Ok, so can you add for the sake of thoroughness, PDFs of the schematics and PCB in the folder you created?
[10:58:19 AM] Andrew: yes I can do that
[10:58:33 AM] Davin Sufer: thanks.  Im really hoping this means that we can start to run
[10:59:45 AM] Andrew: yep the motor boards should be good to go. I spent a LOT of time on the specific pinning of the STM32 to make sure that ALL
                    of the motors could use the STM32 PWM signals, that the SPI and I2S (audio) were able to be used with the actual STM32 hardware 
                    peripherals, PWM for the emitters for GestureSense…
		    
		    
[11:00:18 AM] Andrew: that is were most of the time went, there is an STM32CubeMX data file (don’t remember the name, it ends in ‘.ioc’ 
                      which you can load up in the STM32CubeMX utility to see where everything is
[11:00:45 AM] Andrew: I also brought USB over to the USB 2.0 FS pins on the STM32 so you could instantiate a CDC serial port for debugging the STM32 if you                       wanted
[11:01:29 AM] Andrew: the detector pins can all be configured for external interrupt as well if your software team wanted to use that feature

[11:02:49 AM] Davin Sufer: cool
[11:05:50 AM] Andrew: the motor boards have the correct power routing for battery charging, the SOM board does not. I discovered the mistake while doing 
	            the motor board layout.
[11:06:56 AM] Andrew: it doesn’t matter if the system is being used as a pair — you can plug the battery into the motor board (where you want it anyway 
	            I think, all the high current will be there) and the SOM can grab power from the motor board through that 4x8 connector on the bottom

[11:07:14 AM] Andrew: the SOM board can be used on its own as long as it is powered from USB or a bench supply connected up to the battery
[11:07:17 AM] Andrew: battery port I mean
[11:07:27 AM] Davin Sufer: Raouf, please take notes on all the above and place it in a document in the shared dropbox folder


[11:08:54 AM] Andrew: I have to get you documentation on the resistor population options as well. I specifically created the board pair so that the
                      STM32 can participate as a SPI slave or audio slave since there was some talk about wanting additional audio channels and the way
                      the SOM audio routing
                    works made that really difficult		    		    
[11:09:32 AM] Andrew: the boards are all shipping with the STM32 wired to be the SOM SPI slave (no audio path between STM32 and SOM). but if you change 
	              the resistor population you can disable SPI slave and enable I2S between SOM and STM32
[11:10:26 AM] Andrew: similarly, the emitter and detector hardware is currently all routing to the STM32; some resistor population changes and they can be routed 
                    to the Karin BLE module instead. you can also route only SOME emitters/detectors to the BLE or STM32 if that’s what you want too
[11:12:23 AM] Andrew: I have to run to an appt, but will be available for Skype on my phone (just ask questions here, I’ll get them)
[11:48:02 AM] Davin Sufer: As I can’t open Altium files, we don’t have any idea about pinouts or header assignments until we get your schematics in PDF.  
                    (Raouf has an old schematic).

[11:48:21 AM] Davin Sufer: We will simpy use the cubemx files to move forward as much as we can
[11:51:15 AM] Andrew: ok I will get them to you asap; in the meantime I’m sure there’s a free altium viewer
[11:51:18 AM] Andrew: not ideal I agree
[11:59:43 AM] raouf.bensalem: Good morning Andrew !!
[12:00:16 PM] Andrew: good morning



[12:55:19 PM] Andrew: I put schematics in the dropbox
[12:55:36 PM] Andrew: I am having a hell of a time getting a USABLE assembly drawing out of Altium
[12:56:33 PM] raouf.bensalem: Great !! thank you,
[3:11:18 PM] Davin Sufer: what is voltage range on motor board?  to power the system and the motors?
[3:22:32 PM] Andrew: 5V just because I'm using a USB lipoly charge controller. The buck/boost regulator for the 3.3V  has a max input range of 5.5V
[3:23:09 PM] Andrew: I intentionally split off the motor supply in case you needed >5V for the motors.
[3:24:16 PM] Andrew: You open the 2 jumpers on the board and supply whatever you need for the motors
[3:26:16 PM] Andrew: There's enough room on the board for a boost regulator to give the motors 12 or 24V if needed
[3:26:56 PM] Davin Sufer: Ok, raouf, did you get that?  You can power with 11V, just need to remove some jumpers.
[3:31:21 PM] Davin Sufer: Remove P7 and P8
[3:31:26 PM] Davin Sufer: thats it?
[3:31:37 PM] Davin Sufer: won’t try to charge the power supply if USB is connected
[3:32:50 PM] Andrew: Yes. Then connect B+ to the top two pins. The battery voltage (4.3V) is on the bottom two.
[3:33:09 PM] Andrew: Battery is only charged via USB on that board c
[3:33:13 PM] Andrew: -c
[3:37:25 PM] Davin Sufer: https://www.dropbox.com/s/11x1azcmu5j5ozg/Screenshot%202016-04-04%2015.36.55.png?dl=0
[3:47:39 PM] Davin Sufer: When you say top two pins…  Which top two?
[3:48:51 PM] Andrew: I'm taking the kids home from school. I can make it clear when I'm at a computer.
[3:50:59 PM] Andrew: P7 is the left two pins, P8 the right two. The top of P7 and P8 is the motor supply. The bottom of them is the 4.3V battery
[3:58:08 PM] Davin Sufer: Ok, we are not clear where the battery is supposed to connect or where the motor supply connects to
[3:58:18 PM | Edited 3:58:10 PM] Davin Sufer: IE where is BATT+ / BATT-
[3:58:33 PM] Andrew: Yes. I'll annotate a pic when I'm at home in about 20m
[3:58:36 PM] Davin Sufer: ok
[3:58:49 PM] Andrew: It's just + though
[3:59:07 PM] Davin Sufer: please show the pic by taking a screen of the board layout and using some arrows denoting hookup wires
[3:59:25 PM] Andrew: Top 2 are motor + and bottom two are +4.3
[4:00:55 PM] Andrew: I didn't break out GND as I was thinking more of current measurement. I did not realize you might need > 4.3V but
             this does allow for it
[4:01:22 PM] Davin Sufer: Bottom two go to a lipo battery
[4:01:39 PM] Davin Sufer: so if we power from 11V, we still need to connect a lipo or use USB to power the logic
[4:02:09 PM] Davin Sufer: and where is a good place to connect ground (motor/high current ground)
[4:03:12 PM] Andrew: The JST connector - is a good solid ground point and directly connected to the motor supply ground
[4:03:49 PM] Davin Sufer: the JST (K1) is meant as the 4.2V battery connection
[4:04:02 PM] Davin Sufer: but I can use the ground pin of that as motor supply ground
[4:04:09 PM] Andrew: I should have given a ground connection, didn't think of it
[4:04:12 PM] Andrew: Correct
[4:04:14 PM | Edited 4:04:19 PM] Davin Sufer: and the tops of P7 and P8 as + 11V
[4:04:40 PM] Andrew: There are a bunch of grounds on the 4x8 connector too
[4:05:11 PM] Davin Sufer: also noticed that the nordic has copper behind the antenna
[4:05:19 PM] Andrew: I'll annotate it all
[4:05:21 PM] Davin Sufer: maybe an issue
[4:05:24 PM] Andrew: Hm
[4:05:28 PM] Davin Sufer: 4 layer?
[4:05:33 PM] Andrew: Yes
[4:06:11 PM] Davin Sufer: ok, we can work with that, probably try it but most likely it’ll be an issue for connectivity
[4:09:33 PM] Davin Sufer: for now we can bring the board up using the USB input?
[4:10:05 PM] Davin Sufer: obviously no motor driving because P7 and P8 are not jumpered across so no motor power
[4:19:12 PM] Andrew: Yep. Connect a USB cable and that's power (and eventually USB connectivity if you write it into the firmware). 
Battery can be connected as well (and you can drive 5V motors just fine)
[4:19:34 PM] Andrew: SWD cable attached to the SWD port at the top and you can flash your firmware
[4:20:00 PM] Andrew: I use a little j-link but stlink or any arm-aware debugger should work
             I’ve put a picture in Dropbox that details the power connections
